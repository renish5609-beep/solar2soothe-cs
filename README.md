# Solar2Soothe-CS

Solar2Soothe-CS is an open-source computational project focused on identifying heat-vulnerable communities and modeling solar-powered cooling feasibility under real-world constraints.

## Problem Motivation
Extreme heat disproportionately impacts low-income communities, the elderly, and households with limited access to reliable cooling. As climate change intensifies heatwaves, equitable allocation of cooling resources becomes a critical challenge.

This project approaches the problem from a computational perspective: rather than building hardware first, it models where cooling interventions would have the greatest impact and whether solar-powered systems can realistically meet local needs.

## Project Scope
This repository focuses on:
- Heat vulnerability scoring
- Data-driven prioritization of communities
- Solar + battery + cooling system simulation
- Transparent, interpretable decision models

This project does **not** represent a deployed cooling system.

## Open Source Commitment
Solar2Soothe-CS is released as an open-source project to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in addressing heat and energy inequity.
